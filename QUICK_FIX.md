# 🚀 Quick Fix - Working Setup

## The Problem
Your `package.json` files were empty, which is why `npm install` and `npm run dev` don't work.

## ✅ Fixed Files
- ✅ **Backend package.json** - Now has all dependencies
- ✅ **Frontend package.json** - Already correct
- ✅ **Database schema** - Complete and ready

## 🛠️ Simple Setup (Try This)

### Step 1: Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Frontend  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Database
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
5. Click "Run"

## 🎯 What Should Work Now
- ✅ Backend API on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Frontend on http://localhost:5173  
- ✅ Database with sample data

## 🚨 If Still Not Working
Tell me:
1. What error message do you see?
2. Which step fails?
3. Are you in the correct directory?

## 📋 Quick Test
```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test frontend
# Open http://localhost:5173 in browser
```

**Try the setup now and let me know what happens!** 🚀
