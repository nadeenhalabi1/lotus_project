# Project Overview Document
## HR & Management Reporting Microservice for educoreAI

### Project Summary
The HR & Management Reporting microservice is an intelligent analytics platform designed to consolidate and interpret learning data across educoreAI's ecosystem, providing internal teams with actionable insights about client organization performance and platform effectiveness.

### Problem Statement
educoreAI's internal administrators and HR staff currently struggle with fragmented data across multiple microservices, requiring manual aggregation and interpretation of learning analytics. This creates inefficiencies in tracking platform effectiveness, identifying client needs, and measuring learning outcomes, ultimately limiting the organization's ability to demonstrate value and make strategic decisions.
