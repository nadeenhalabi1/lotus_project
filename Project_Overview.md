# Project Overview Document
## educoreAI Management Reporting Microservice

### Project Summary
The **Management Reporting Microservice** is an AI-powered internal analytics platform designed exclusively for educoreAI's executive management team. This system serves as the central reporting and insight hub, providing consolidated, intelligent reporting across all educoreAI microservices to enable data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

### Problem Statement
educoreAI faces a critical challenge in accessing consolidated, accurate, and up-to-date information about platform activity, product performance, and user engagement across all client organizations. Currently, relevant data is scattered across multiple independent microservices, forcing manual data gathering and inconsistent analysis that leads to inefficiencies and incomplete visibility into system-wide performance.

### Project Vision
Transform educoreAI's decision-making process from reactive and intuition-based to proactive and data-driven by providing executive management with a unified, AI-enhanced reporting hub that consolidates all essential operational data into an accessible, visual, and actionable format.

### Target Users & Stakeholders
- **Primary Users:** educoreAI's executive management team (C-level executives, heads of operations, product executives)
- **Access Level:** Administrator-level authorization only
- **User Count:** Small, exclusive group of top-level decision-makers
- **Decision Authority:** Executive management uses insights for strategic planning and business decisions

### Core Objectives

#### Primary Objectives:
1. **Data Consolidation:** Consolidate all operational and business data from multiple microservices into a single, unified reporting interface
2. **Performance Visibility:** Enable management to easily identify performance issues, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement
3. **AI-Driven Intelligence:** Integrate an AI-driven analytics layer providing real-time alerts, insights, and forecasts
4. **Decision Transformation:** Transform decision-making into a data-driven, efficient, and proactive process

#### Success Metrics (KPIs):
- **Usage Frequency:** Frequency of use by executive management indicating operational value
- **Time Reduction:** Reduction in time required to generate reports compared to manual processes
- **AI Accuracy:** Percentage of AI-generated alerts and recommendations approved/acted upon by management
- **Decision Speed:** Improvement in decision-making speed and precision
- **Automation Level:** Decrease in manual data processing effort

### Innovation & Differentiation

#### Key Innovation Pillars:

1. **Real-Time AI-Driven Analysis**
   - Intelligent, automated analysis using internal AI engine
   - Anomaly detection and pattern recognition across system components
   - Data-backed alerts, explanations, and actionable recommendations

2. **Cross-Organizational Data Integration**
   - Horizontal data consolidation across multiple microservices
   - Holistic view of platform performance
   - Discovery of correlations and dependencies previously invisible
   - Integration of learning progress, assessments, skills, and performance metrics

3. **Full Automation of Insight Generation**
   - Automated data filtering, normalization, and analysis
   - Clear visual presentation without manual interpretation
   - Continuous learning from management feedback
   - Refinement of inference models for increased accuracy

### Technical Scope
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + Supabase + Redis
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Cache:** Redis
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API integration
